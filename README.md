# 2018 FIFA World Cup Group Distribution
• Distributed the national teams across the groups to balance capability and geography.            
• Implemented the DPLL algorithm to solve the propositional satisfiability problem using python 2.7.                  

To be more specific, the task is to take the list of qualifying teams and assign them to groups based on
which confederation and pot they are in. The draw must satisfy both of the following constraints:               
C1. No group can have more than one team from any pot.                            
C2. No group can have more than one team from any continental confederation, with the exception of UEFA, which can have up to two teams in a group.                             
There is no limit (minimum or maximum) on the number of teams in each group.
